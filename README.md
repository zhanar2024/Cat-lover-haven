# Code The Dream Advanced Pre-Work Assignment

Hello! I am a HUGE Cat Lover and decided to make this assignment on CATS!;

This an interactive, dynamic webpagethat serves content from TheCatAPI (https://thecatapi.com/);
I used async/await and Promises to create synchronous logic in asynchronous actions.
Also, used fetch or Axios, POST data to and DELETE data frm an external API.
This project has been deployed on the Netlify and has the following link:
